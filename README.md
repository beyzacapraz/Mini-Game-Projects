# Mini-Game-Projects
 Simple game projects I made during the training period of my internship in Beren Studio. 
 The company mainly dwells on VR & AR games, Mobile Game Development, 3D modeling for Metaverse, and Deep Learning. 

 # Solar System Simulation

After learning advanced rotation methods, quaternions, lerp, and slerp. Using these, I made a solar system representation that consists of planets, their satellites, and some meteors.
While creating this game, I also learned how to add some assets and textures and make some texture graphics.

# Roll a Ball

After learning the tools of Unity, scaling, organizing assets, creating objects, creating a player, movement of the player,
collision and basic rotation, joints, coroutines, yield return, and timer logic, I made a simple ball game.

The purpose is to try not to collect -1 coins, if the player reaches -1 then unfortunately the game will restart again.   
The purpose was to collect the highest amounts of coins.  The yellow cubes represent coins while the purple ones are bombs representing -1 points. 
If you hit the side walls, you also get -1 points. I also added the door mechanism and timer logic. If the player cannot get any coins within 5 seconds the game will restart.

# Zombie Maze

Following these, I moved on to creating a PC player, so I learned how to create a first-person controller, mouse movement, player movement, and health bar. 
I also learned how to use animations. I made the enemy follow the player and attack if the enemy came too close to the player using the navmesh attribute, a simple AI attribute that made the enemy follow the blue road with a constant velocity. I used a cannibal model and animations of it.

Using these, I have developed a mini horror game. The cannibal follows us in a twisting maze and the player tries to run from the cannibal without dying. If the player reaches the end of the maze, then congrats, you have won the game!
